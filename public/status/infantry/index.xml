      <description>Inspired by Chapter 3 of 1984 - Orwell, where Winston tries to remember what happened to his family and what happened in the past. However, the past was rewritten and the process of &amp;ldquo;rectifying&amp;rdquo; the history was vividly depicted in Chapter 4. However, to have the absolute power of dictate even the language requires real management skills and also a set of conditions&amp;hellip; I am curious how feasible it is in real life and what are conditions needed to make it happens.</description>
