keywords Fiction / Classics,Fiction / Dystopian,politicalNovel Motivation for reading Having said so many times that my own country is rushing into the story of 1984 so many times I am finally reading the book in detail.
Background The book is published in 1949, but Orwell has more in mind than the anti-communist sentiments in the work. In Orwell&amp;rsquo;s thought, he found analogy between the British Labour Party and the Communist Party under Stalin and consider himself the left of the left.</description>

      <description>tags Fiction/Classics author Fyodor Dostoevsky Motivation for reading Heavily referenced in Camus&amp;rsquo; Rabel.
Memo Quote Ivan&amp;rsquo;s view of the physical world and religion I have a Euclidian earthly mind, and how could I solve problems that are not of this world? And I advise you never to think about it either, my dear Alyosha, especially about God, whether He exists or not. All such questions are utterly inappropriate for a mind created with an idea of only three dimensions.</description>
