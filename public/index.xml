      <description>1. Nietzsche starts the first chapter of the book by questioning the &amp;ldquo;Will of Truth&amp;rdquo; - if there&amp;rsquo;s a will to truth, why not untruth? Nietzsche pointed that philosophers devoted themselves to the &amp;ldquo;Will of Truth&amp;rdquo; without questioning the origin of the will. He also mentioned such question is Dangerous.

      <description>This post is inspired by Mike Zamansky&amp;rsquo;s video channel on youtube1.Since I am now using Arc as my main browser so usually I don&amp;rsquo;t usually need to manage my bookmark, sometimes when I saw interesting blogs and information, I still want to have it somewhere and preferably an annotation to tell me why I store it at the first place, to have this sort of bookmark in my emacs comes in handy.</description>

Being well known as a dystopia book, the book is well known for depicting a despotism regime. And because of its reputation, I have been kept saying my own home country converging towards the world in 1984 in an accelerating book.</description>

Memo Quote Ch1-3 As little as the act of birth comes into consideration in the whole process and procedure of heredity, just as little is “being-conscious” as opposed to the instinctive in any decisive sense; the greater part of the conscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly influenced by his instincts, and forced into definite channels.</description>

Memo Quote Ivan&amp;rsquo;s view of the physical world and religion I have a Euclidian earthly mind, and how could I solve problems that are not of this world? And I advise you never to think about it either, my dear Alyosha, especially about God, whether He exists or not. All such questions are utterly inappropriate for a mind created with an idea of only three dimensions.</description>

      <description>This is a post on configuring org-protocol for people using Emacs on MacOS with AMD chips. The documentary only contains configuration for up to MacOs built on Intel chips. I will also include the steps I have taken to figure the problem out with very limited programming and computer background knowledge.
First, load org-protocol.el to the init.el configuration file:
1(server-start) 2(add-to-list &amp;#39;load-path &amp;#34;~/path/to/org/protocol/&amp;#34;) 3(require &amp;#39;org-protocol) Note that org-protocol.el comes with the org-mode so it&amp;rsquo;s not in any package archives.</description>
