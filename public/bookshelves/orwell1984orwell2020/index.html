<h2 id="motivation-for-reading">Motivation for reading</h2>
<p>The book itself is well known by people in general but I have always always been one of which who never read the book before. Being well known as a dystopia book, the book is well known for depicting a despotism regime. And because of its reputation, I have been kept saying my own home country converging towards the world in 1984 in an accelerating book.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s the time I should sit down and read the book in details to be mentally prepared for what&rsquo;s waiting for my country in the foreseeable forture&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The book is published in 1949, but Orwell has more in mind than the anti-comminist sentiments in the work. In Orwell&rsquo;s thought, he found analogy between the British Labour Party and the Communist Party under Stalin and consider himself the left of the left. In his idea, both parties claimed to present the interest of working classes and fight against the communist, but in reality concerned only with perpetuating their own power.</p>
<p>In 1945, the Tory-led labour party won the British eletorate and got the first time opportunity to reshape the Biritish society along the socialist line. However, according to his letters, he was worried how likely the Labour will stick with its original ideals and choose not to extend the scope of its power. (Judging by the plot of the book he&rsquo;s probably very negative about the prospect&hellip;)</p>
<p>Beside, he&rsquo;s very happy about the widespread allgiance to Stalinism among the lefe despite overwelming evidence of its evil nature, as uncovered from one of his letter he wrote in March of 1948:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For somewhat complex reasons, nearly the whole of the English Left has been driven to accept the Russian regime as “Socialist”, while silently recognizing that its spirit and practice are quite alien to anything that is meant by “Socialism” in this country. Hence there has arisen a sort of schizophrenic manner of thinking, in which words like “democracy” can bear two irreconcilable meanings, and such things as concentration camps and mass deportations can be right and wrong simultaneously.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="memo-quote">Memo Quote</h2>
<h3 id="on-language-and-thought">On language and thought</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The whole literature of the past will have been destroyed. Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Byron – they’ll exist only in Newspeak versions, not merely changed into something different, but actually changed into something contradictory of what they used to be. Even the literature of the Party will change. Even the slogans will change. How could you have a slogan like “freedom is slavery” when the concept of freedom has been abolished? The whole climate of thought will be different. In fact there will be no thought, as we understand it now. <strong>Orthodoxy means not thinking – not needing to think. Orthodoxy is unconsciousness</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="on-what-s-the-implication-a-future">On what&rsquo;s the implication a &ldquo;future&rdquo;</h3>
<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s no future, if future only resamble the present.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>For whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he writing this diary? For the future, for the unborn. His mind hovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the page, and then fetched up with a bump against the Newspeak word doublethink. For the first time the magnitude of what he had undertaken came home to him. How could you communicate with the future? It was of its nature impossible. Either the future would resemble the present, in which case it would not listen to him: or it would be different from it, and his predicament would be meaningless.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="on-group-polorization--during-three-mins-hates">On group polorization (during three mins hates)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The little sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landed fish. Even O’Brien’s heavy face was flushed. He was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling and quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave. The dark-haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out ‘Swine! Swine! Swine!’, and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen. It struck Goldstein’s nose and bounced off: the voice continued inexorably. In a lucid moment Winston found that he was shouting with the others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair. <strong>The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but that it was impossible to avoid joining in.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="on-sex-oppression">On sex oppression</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>It was even possible, at moments, to switch one’s hatred this way or that by a voluntary act. Suddenly, by the sort of violent effort with which one wrenches one’s head away from the pillow in a nightmare, Winston succeeded in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark-haired girl behind him. Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind. He would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon. He would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian. He would ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax. Better than before, moreover, he realized why it was that he hated her. He hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity.</p>

<li>I am where Wilson is having a conversation with Syme, and it&rsquo;s so
funny Winston has the conviction that he will definitely be
vaporized one day&hellip;&ldquo;One day he will disppear. It&rsquo;s written in his
face.&rdquo; This conviction in plain English is just hilarious.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>One of these days, thought Winston with sudden deep conviction, Syme will be vaporized. He is too intelligent. He sees too clearly and speaks too plainly. The Party does not like such people. One day he will disappear. It is written in his face.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>the idea of changing the language to control thought is very
interesting and also sounds true enough to me.</li>
<li>The idea of the destruction of words&hellip; I have had similar questions
about it, if there&rsquo;s a prefix to add the opposite connotation for a
word, why bother to invent another word to indicate an opposite
meaning&hellip; It&rsquo;s so redundant.</li>

<ul>
<li>The second day of reading the book I was too tired yesterday and didn&rsquo;t read a lot&hellip;</li>
<li>Finished chapter 2, I don&rsquo;t particularly enjoy reading a political
novel but this book is beyond my expectation so far. I love who
Orwell depicts Winston&rsquo;s revelation during the three mins hates, where
he realized the hatred towards the sandy-haired woman was due to the
scarlet sash round her sweet, which symbolizes chastity.</li>
<li>The part where Orwell describes the hint of frightfulness in the
grayish haired woman&rsquo;s face toward her children is very
touching. It&rsquo;s ironic to even think the book is published in 1949,
the same year another despotism regime gained firm control of a new a
a born country that will, through its propaganda and ideological
control, and spies on people&rsquo;s thought crimes, which culminate to
the tragedy exactly as described in the book&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>With those children, he thought, that wretched woman must lead a life of terror. Another year, two years, and they would be watching her night and day for symptoms of unorthodoxy. Nearly all children nowadays were horrible. What was worst of all was that by means of such organisations as the Spies they were systematically turned into ungovernable little savages, and yet this produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the discipline of the Party. On the contrary, they adored the Party and everything connected with it. The songs, the processions, the banners, the hiking, the drilling with dummy rifles, the yelling of slogans, the worship of Big Brother – it was all a sort of glorious game to them. All their ferocity was turned outwards, against the enemies of the State, against foreigners, traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals. It was almost normal for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children.</p>
