      <description>tags Fiction/Classics author Fyodor Dostoevsky Motivation for reading Heavily referenced in Camus&amp;rsquo; Rabel.
Memo Quote Ivan&amp;rsquo;s view of the physical world and religion I have a Euclidian earthly mind, and how could I solve problems that are not of this world? And I advise you never to think about it either, my dear Alyosha, especially about God, whether He exists or not. All such questions are utterly inappropriate for a mind created with an idea of only three dimensions.</description>

      <description>I am a heavy reader who loves reading about philosophy, history and politics. I also love classic literature a lot. Sometimes I read reviews, analyses and background stories that relate to the pieces I am reading and the desire to put all those dots together motivates me to create this site in the first place.
This page is dedicated to the list of books and articles I have read and currently reading that I find inspiring and interesting.</description>
