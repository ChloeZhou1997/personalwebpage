      <description>The Strait of Malacca is a narrow strait between the Malay Peninsula and the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It is one of the most important shipping lanes in the world, linking the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, and carrying up to one-third of the world&amp;rsquo;s maritime trade, including oil and gas shipments from the Persian Gulf. The strait also plays an important role in geopolitics, as several countries in the region have strategic interests in controlling access to the strait.</description>
