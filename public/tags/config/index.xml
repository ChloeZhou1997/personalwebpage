      <description>This is a post on configuring org-protocol for people using Emacs on MacOS with AMD chips. The documentary only contains configuration for up to MacOs built on Intel chips. I will also include the steps I have taken to figure the problem out with very limited programming and computer background knowledge.
First, load org-protocol.el to the init.el configuration file:
1(server-start) 2(add-to-list &amp;#39;load-path &amp;#34;~/path/to/org/protocol/&amp;#34;) 3(require &amp;#39;org-protocol) Note that org-protocol.el comes with the org-mode so it&amp;rsquo;s not in any package archives.</description>

      <title>Emacs Configuration</title>

      <description>This is the Emacs configuration built from scratch following system crafter and Mike Zamansky&amp;rsquo;s youtube videos. As someone with only limited experience in running statistical models in R it&amp;rsquo;s been a confusing exprience to finally build vague understanding of what&amp;rsquo;s going on behind the scene.
This literal configuration, by the time the post was written is still a patchwork of pieces I have taken from different places. My goal is to taking notes of concepts and syntax along the way when reorganizing the configuration file so that the documentation will be self-contained and &amp;ldquo;dummy-friendly&amp;rdquo; for people like me who wants to start using emacs to boost their productivities but have very little idea of anything relates to programming at the beginning of their journey.</description>
