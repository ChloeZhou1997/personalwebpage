<p>Nietzsche pointed that philosophers devoted themselves to the &ldquo;Will of Truth&rdquo; without questioning the origin of the will. He also mentioned such question is <em>Dangerous</em>.</p>
<h3 id="sphnix-and-oedipus">Sphnix and Oedipus</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphinx">Sphnix</a> is a mythical creature with a head of a human, the body of a lion and the wings of a falcon. According to legend, he&rsquo;s guarded the Greek city of Thebes and fond of asking riddles to travelers. However, Oedipus was able to solve all the riddles Sphnix gave, Sphnix threw herself from her high rock and died.</p>
<h3 id="the-will-to-truth">The Will to Truth</h3>
<p>The tendency to seek out and believe in the truth even in hard circumstances. (But whether it is the truth that people are seeking, or a desire to believe something as truth/good?)</p>

The fundamental belief of metaphysicians is <em>the belief in antitheses of values</em>. Metaphysicians hold no doubt of this presupposition. Venturing into questioning such belief is dangerous but inevitable.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nietzsche questions the fundamental belief in metaphysics, that things cannot originate from their opposition. The highest values must come into being.</li>
<li>If we venture to question such belief: virtues might steam from vise. The fundamental values of life might be attributed to the pretense, the will to deception etc.</li>
<li>Nietzsche believes that such investigation is inevitable and is immerging.</li>

<li>Personal understanding: The dichotomy of values, things are either good or bad, true or untrue but not in between. And there is no room for things might be in between, or fostering each other&hellip; That&rsquo;s why build from this Nietzsche criticizes the foundation the philosophy is built upon - a truth that is absolute and unarguable, built from the philosopher&rsquo;s own prejudice.</li>

The usual falseness of opinion needs little doubt, what matter is to find the opinions that are life-furthering and species-raring. What we are undoubled about so far is only a negation of life and to recognize the untruth is the movement that places itself beyond good and evil.</h2>

The reason people tend to distrust and make fun of philosophers is not because they keep making innocent mistakes or because they seem childish, but because philosophers are not honest about their opinions. Instead of admitting that they might be biased, philosophers pretend that their opinions are based on a logical, reasoning process when really they are just defending their own prejudices.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nietzsche mocked both Kant and Spinoza for their philosophy. For Kant, it&rsquo;s his dialetics that leads to categorical imperative; for Spinoza, it&rsquo;s his claims for embedded the mathematical form in his philosophy, and called it &ldquo;hocuspocus&rdquo;&hellip; (he only used them to scare people away for he himself is not confident about he&rsquo;s thought)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tartuffery-of-old-kant">[Tartuffery] of old Kant</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tartuffery is the practice of pretending to be virtuous or holy in order to deceive others. The term is often used to refer to religious hypocrisy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="categorical-imperative--绝对律令">categorical imperative (绝对律令)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Imperative: absolute command or order</li>
<li>The categorical imperative is an ethical principle developed by Kant. It states that an action is morally good if it can be willed as a universal law, i.e. if it could be applied to everyone without leading to a contradiction.</li>

To understand a difficult metaphysical assertion from a philsopher, one only needs to figure out what morality the philosopher is aiming at. For it&rsquo;s the moral purpose of the philosopher that dictates the shape his philosophy will eventually grow in. There&rsquo;s nothing in philosophy that is absolutely impersonal.</h2>
<p>How did he work up to this conclusion?</p>
<ul>
<li>Nietzsche doesn&rsquo;t believe in the &ldquo;impulse to knowledge&rdquo; as the
father of philosophy. Instead, the impulse to knowledge stems from
the need to use them as a tool.</li>
<li>However, he believes whoever thinks of himself as creative and
inspiring and certainly possesses that &ldquo;impulse&rdquo; are certainly
willing to consider themselves superior to others as it&rsquo;s what
impulse does - imperious and hence tend to &ldquo;philosophize&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Unlike scientific scholars, even though most of their impulses might
be driven by material interests, there might be a tiny bit of
interests that are purely driven by curiosity and the genuine
interest itself. And the fact that most of the interests are in
money making or family, is what makes it impersonal. For the
actions and what they do usually don&rsquo;t characterize what they are.</li>
<li>This is not the case for philosophers. What they choose for their
moral compass is the testimony of where their natures stand.</li>
