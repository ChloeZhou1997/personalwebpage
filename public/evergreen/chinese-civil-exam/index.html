<ul>

system of Dynastic China</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-foundation-zhou-dynasty--ca-dot-1100-256-bce">The foundation: Zhou Dynasty (ca. 1100â€“256 BCE)</h3>
<p>Although many believed that the Zhou Dynasty wrote texts that
served as the foundation for the system of civil service
examinations, it has since been shown that these texts were
reconstructions written in the first centuries BCE. The Zhou
Dynasty is part of the Three Dynasties of Antiquity, which is seen
as a golden age in which the key elements of civilization were
created and served as models for later Chinese
polities. Therefore, the institutional history of the civil
service examinations predates the Three Dynasties.</p>
<h3 id="han-dynasty">Han Dynasty?</h3>
<h3 id="sui--581-618--and-tang--618-907--the-pattern-for-later-dynasties-were-established-by-empress-wu">Sui(581-618) and Tang(618-907): the pattern for later dynasties were established by Empress Wu</h3>
<p>The examinations were used to both promote and assign posts to those
already serving, as well as to those who had been recommended for
office.</p>
<p>The civil examinations were institutionalized during this period
of time. One of the reasons the emperors love this system is it
helps to reduce the power of aristocratic families who had strong
political power in the previous five centuries.</p>
<p>This motive can be best seen in the reign of Empress Wu, who
claimed the thrown after oversaw two of her sons. She relied on
the examinations to recruit more new officials than any of her
predecessors. Successful examination candidates attained the
highest positions in the bureaucracy, allowing Empress Wu to gain
more control over her reign.</p>
<h3 id="song--960-1276--the-examination-process-becomes-competitive">Song (960-1276): the examination process becomes competitive</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>New rulers opted to select officials based on a competitive
process and not solely on family pedigree or wealth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pushed the use of the examinations further as part of the
rulers&rsquo; attempt to curb the power of the regional military
commanders and powerful families</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the early period, still more people entered the officialdom<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
through recommendations from powerful patrons or inheriting
positions from family connections than from examinations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of candidates attending the Song qualifying
prefectural examinations<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> increased from 20k to 400k from
early 11th century to mid-13th century, by the end, the
estimated population is about 50m.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="after-song">After Song</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The exams were the most important way to get a job in the
government. People who did the best on the exams got the best
jobs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of candidates grew at <strong>exponential rates</strong>, and the
overall numbers continues to increase during Ming(1368-1644) and
Qing dynasty(1644-1911). The increase in the number of candidates
corresponds to the demographic trend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By 1850, the number of candidates for the local examinations had
increased to about 2m out of a population of 430m.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, during the period when the state coffers were depleted
(As in Qing dynasty), to take the exams, people had to
prove that they had a good family background. As more and more
people took the exams and competed for official positions, more
people received titles and jobs through their family connections
or by buying them instead of getting them through the exams.</p>

<h3 id="on-social-reproduction-and-social-mobility">On Social Reproduction<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and Social Mobility</h3>
<p>There were quantitative research suggesting the number of
successful examination candidates, over 50% in the Southern Song,
49.5% in the Ming and 37.6% in the Qing came from families with no
immediate patrilineal forefathers in the bureaucracy. However,
even though the examinations were supposed to be open to everyone,
many people were excluded from taking them, such as monks and
priests, beggars, sons of prostitutes, craftsmen, clerks, and
merchants. Also, even if someone managed to take the exams, their
success was still strongly influenced by their family
background. This means that if someone&rsquo;s family was wealthy and
powerful, they had a better chance of doing well in the exams. So,
even though the exams were supposed to offer people a chance to
move up in society, it was still very hard for people from
underprivileged backgrounds to do this.</p>
<h3 id="on-creating-new-social-group">On Creating New Social Group</h3>
<p>The civil exam system creates demands for instructions on how to
prepare for the various genre tests. People who happen to meet the
demands tend to be those who prepared for it themselves. This
creates a self-sustaining loop and creates the empire-wide social
group &ldquo;literati&rdquo;.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> This was called &rsquo;early modern literate
industriousness&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> which means that these people worked hard to
become educated.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://inference-review.com/article/the-chinese-civil-examinations">article</a> has a brief section on the historical development
of China&rsquo;s civil exam system. The interesting part is the
investigation of the curriculum of the exam but the article doesn&rsquo;t
really have a critical analysis on why it keeps on attracting more
candidates despite the declining odds of success.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Officialdom is the collective body of officials and government
agents that operate within a system of government, typically with the

<p>Prefectural examinations refer to examinations administered at
the prefectural level, which are the highest level of examinations
administered at the provincial level and which require candidates to
travel to the provincial and metropolitan centers of political
power. These examinations are the final step in the examination
process and are typically administered and evaluated by the imperial
court or bureaucracy.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>The literati were a special group of people who were not just
literate, but also had a lot of knowledge about written and physical
cultures, languages, and social customs. This group was connected to
each other in a way that was unique compared to other groups in
Chinese history. People who took part in the exams were part of this
group. As the wealth of the Chinese territories increased, especially
in the southeast, more people wanted to take the exams. But the
Chinese government wanted to keep the number of people who passed the
exams low, so the chances of passing were very slim. In some places,
only 1 in 200 people managed to pass the exams. This was much harder
than any modern exam or grant competition.&#160;<a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
