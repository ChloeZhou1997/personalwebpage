<p>Iran is a very mountainous country, which makes it hard to have an
economy with all the different parts connected. There are lots of
different minority groups living in Iran, each with its own culture
and language. For example, Khuzestan is mostly Arab, and there are
also Kurds, Azeri, Turkmen and Georgians. Most people in Iran speak
Farsi, which is the language of the Persian majority. Because of this
diversity, Iran&rsquo;s leaders have usually used military force and a
powerful security service to keep the country safe. Iran&rsquo;s leaders
know that no one is planning to attack them, but they also know that
other countries could use Iran&rsquo;s minorities to cause trouble and try
to change the government.</p>
<h4 id="potential-problem-nuclear-weapons-threatening-other-countries">Potential problem: nuclear weapons threatening other countries</h4>
<p>Many countries, especially Israel, are afraid that Iran is trying to
build nuclear weapons which could cause a lot of tension in the
area. The Israelis are scared because if Iran gets nuclear weapons,
other countries in the region like Saudi Arabia might want to get them
too. This would mean that Iran would be the biggest and most powerful
country in the region. To prevent this, the Saudis might try to buy
nuclear weapons from Pakistan. Israel might try to stop this from
happening by sending a plane to attack Iran&rsquo;s nuclear facilities, but
this would be very difficult because it is a long way away, and it
would also risk angering Iraq and other countries in the area. Another
problem is that Iran could close the <a href="/evergreen/strait-of-hormuz/">Strait of Hormuz</a> which could
cause problems for the whole world. That&rsquo;s why so many countries are
trying to stop Israel from attacking Iran.</p>

<p>In the book <a href="/bookshelves/marshallprisonersgeographyten2015/#prisoner-of-geography">Prisoner of Geography</a>, the author brought up that
continued rejection from the EU, plus the refusal of many Turks to
become secularized resulted in Turkish politicians seeking &ldquo;Plan B&rdquo;,

<p>Israel, Cyprus, and Greece are working together to get energy from the
gas fields near their coasts. Turkey could have gotten energy from
Israel, if their relationships are more reconciliatory. However,
because of the strained diplomatic relationship, they are still
relying on Russia for their energy needs. They are also working with
Russia builds pipelines so they can get the energy to other
countries in Europe.</p>
