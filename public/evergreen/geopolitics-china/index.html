<h2 id="what-are-china-s-geopolitical-interests">What are China&rsquo;s geopolitical interests</h2>
<p>China&rsquo;s geopolitical interests include controlling access to the
<a href="/evergreen/strait-of-malacca/">Strait of Malacca</a>, which provides access to the world&rsquo;s most important
shipping lanes in the South China Sea; controlling access to Tibet and
the Tibetan Plateau, which gives them access to the Tibetan sources of
three of China&rsquo;s great rivers, the Yellow, Yangtze, and Mekong;
controlling access to the oil, minerals, precious metals, and markets
of Africa; and maintaining amicable relations with Russia and other
states along the Strait of Malacca and the South China Sea, while also
protecting its territorial claims and interests in these regions.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-tibet-strategically-important-to-china-s-geopolitics">Why is Tibet strategically important to China&rsquo;s geopolitics</h2>
<p>Tibet is strategically important to China&rsquo;s geopolitics due to its
location between India and China.</p>
<p>The Himalayas and Karakorum Range form a natural barrier along the
Chinese-Indian border, effectively blocking military and economic
contact between the two most populous countries in the world. This
&lsquo;Great Wall&rsquo; serves as an inescapable reminder of their separation.</p>
<p>By controlling Tibet, China can prevent India from having access to
it, and prevent India from basing military forces there, which would
give them the commanding heights, and a base from which india
might be able to push to the Chinese heartland. Additionally, Tibet is
home to the sources of three of China&rsquo;s great rivers, making it known
as &ldquo;China&rsquo;s Water Tower&rdquo;. China needs to control Tibet in order to
ensure its access to these vital resources and protect their
security.</p>
<h2 id="china-s-geopolitical-interests-along-the-side-of-the-pacific">China&rsquo;s geopolitical interests along the side of the Pacific</h2>
<p>The access to the Pacific from the coastal area of China has in
between the &ldquo;First Island Chain&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and
&ldquo;Nine-dash-line&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Free access to the Pacific might not be a
problem in peaceful times but can be fatal during wartime.</p>

<p>The region matters to China&rsquo;s geopolitical interests for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They might want their ships to pass through the East China Sea off
Shanghai, passing through Ryukyu Island which includes Okinawa,
into the Pacific.</p>
<p>The Americans have a military base around Okinawa when during
conflicts, the Japanese can pile up as many shore-to-ship
missilesÂ <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> as they can.</p>

<p>The First Island Chain is a defensive naval strategy employed by China to secure its maritime borders. It involves the creation of an archipelago of military bases and fortifications along a line of islands stretching from the Kuril Islands in the north to the Malay Archipelago in the south. The goal of the strategy is to protect China&rsquo;s territorial waters and prevent hostile powers from entering the region.</p>

<p>The Nine-Dash Line, also known as the Nine-Dotted Line, is a territorial demarcation line claimed by the People&rsquo;s Republic of China (PRC) in the South China Sea. It is the basis of the PRC&rsquo;s claim to nearly all of the waters and islands of the South China Sea, and is used by the PRC to justify its extensive territorial claims in the area.</p>
