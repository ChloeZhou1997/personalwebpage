<h2 id="what-are-the-geopolitical-interests-of-contemporary-china">What are the geopolitical interests of contemporary China</h2>
<p>China&rsquo;s geopolitical interests include controlling access to the
<a href="/evergreen/strait-of-malacca/">Strait of Malacca</a>, which provides access to the world&rsquo;s most important
shipping lanes in the South China Sea; controlling access to Tibet and
the Tibetan Plateau, which gives them access to the Tibetan sources of
three of China&rsquo;s great rivers, the Yellow, Yangtze, and Mekong;
controlling access to the oil, minerals, precious metals, and markets
of Africa; and maintaining amicable relations with Russia and other
states along the Strait of Malacca and the South China Sea, while also
protecting its territorial claims and interests in these regions.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-land">On the Land</h2>
<h3 id="buffer-zone-on-the-land-tibet">Buffer Zone on the land: Tibet</h3>
<p>Tibet is strategically important to China&rsquo;s geopolitics due to its
location between India and China.</p>
<p>The Himalayas and Karakorum Range form a natural barrier along the
Chinese-Indian border, effectively blocking military and economic
contact between the two most populous countries in the world. This
&lsquo;Great Wall&rsquo; serves as an inescapable reminder of their separation.</p>
<p>By controlling Tibet, China can prevent India from having access to
it, and prevent India from basing military forces there, which would
give them the commanding heights, and a base from which india
might be able to push to the Chinese heartland. Additionally, Tibet is
home to the sources of three of China&rsquo;s great rivers, making it known
as &ldquo;China&rsquo;s Water Tower&rdquo;. China needs to control Tibet in order to
ensure its access to these vital resources and protect their
security.</p>

<p>The gap between the desert and the mountain makes a weak spot to
China&rsquo;s defense, but it&rsquo;s far from the heart land, so less crutial.</p>

<h3 id="another-buffer-zone-on-the-land-xinjiang">Another Buffer Zone on the Land: Xinjiang</h3>
<p>Xinjiang is strategically important to China because it boarders with
Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan,
Pakistan and India. It is also the place that has oil and where China
conducts its nuclear weapon tests.</p>
<h2 id="along-the-side-of-the-pacific">Along the side of the Pacific</h2>
<p>The access to the Pacific from the coastal area of China has in
between the &ldquo;First Island Chain&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and
&ldquo;Nine-dash-line&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Free access to the Pacific might not be a
problem in peaceful times but can be fatal during wartime.</p>

<p>The region matters to China&rsquo;s geopolitical interests for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They might want their ships to pass through the East China Sea
off Shanghai, passing through Ryukyu Island which includes
Okinawa, into the Pacific.</p>
<p>The Americans have a military base around Okinawa when
during conflicts, the Japanese can pile up as many
shore-to-ship missiles <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> as they can.</p>

<li>

<h4 id="historical-fact">Historical fact</h4>
<p>Taiwan has been under Chinese control since the seventeenth
century, but it has only been ruled by China for five years in
the last century (1945-1949). Currently, it is an American ally,
with its navy and air force armed by Washington.</p>

<p>The South China Sea is the subject of a dispute between China and
several other countries, including Malaysia, Taiwan, Vietnam,the
Philippines, and Brunei. Each country has their own competing
claims about fishing zones, exploration rights, and sovereignty,
illustrated by the example of the Mischief Islands<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> in the
Spratly Islands. These disputes involve hundreds of atolls, as
well as smaller rocks in the water.</p>

<h3 id="indian-ocean-conflicts-with-india">Indian Ocean: conflicts with India</h3>
<p>According to geopolitical writer Robert Kaplan, China wants to
become the two-ocean power(Pacific and Indian), as what Americans
once did in the Caribbean (which helps to consolidate the USA&rsquo;s
power in both the Atlantic and Pacific).</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>China is taking a multi-faceted approach to become a two-ocean
power. This includes building a Blue Water navy<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, investing
in deep-water ports in countries bordering the Indian Ocean and
Bay of Bengal<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, The measure helps to secure its access to the
Pacific and Indian Oceans and to reduce its reliance on the
<a href="/evergreen/strait-of-malacca/">Strait of
Malacca</a>. China is also attempting to diplomatically win the
favor of South-East Asian countries and is investing in
construction projects and lending money to the governments. For
example, it beat a path to Burma, when the Burmese Junta<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>
gradually opens its door to the outside of the world in 2010.</p>

<p>The First Island Chain is a defensive naval strategy employed by China to secure its maritime borders. It involves the creation of an archipelago of military bases and fortifications along a line of islands stretching from the Kuril Islands in the north to the Malay Archipelago in the south. The goal of the strategy is to protect China&rsquo;s territorial waters and prevent hostile powers from entering the region.</p>

<p>The Nine-Dash Line, also known as the Nine-Dotted Line, is a territorial demarcation line claimed by the People&rsquo;s Republic of China (PRC) in the South China Sea. It is the basis of the PRC&rsquo;s claim to nearly all of the waters and islands of the South China Sea, and is used by the PRC to justify its extensive territorial claims in the area.</p>

<p>Blue Water navy is a term used to refer to a navy that is
capable of operating in open ocean areas far from the shore, rather
than just in coastal waters. This type of navy is typically equipped
with a variety of ships, aircraft, and submarines that are designed to
operate in deep water. A Blue Water navy is essential for a country to
maintain a presence in the open oceans and to project its power
globally.&#160;<a href="#fnref:6" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
