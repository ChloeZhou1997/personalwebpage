<li>Nietzsche mocked both Kant and Spinoza for their philosophy.

<p>How did he work up to this conclusion?</p>
<ul>
<li>Nietzsche doesn&rsquo;t believe in the &ldquo;impulse to knowledge&rdquo; as the
father of philosophy. Instead, the impulse to knowledge stems from
the need to use them as a tool.</li>
<li>However, he believes whoever thinks of himself as creative and
inspiring and certainly possesses that &ldquo;impulse&rdquo; are certainly
willing to consider themselves superior to others as it&rsquo;s what
impulse does - imperious and hence tend to &ldquo;philosophize&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Unlike scientific scholars, even though most of their impulses might
be driven by material interests, there might be a tiny bit of
interests that are purely driven by curiosity and the genuine
interest itself. And the fact that most of the interests are in
money making or family, is what makes it impersonal. For the
actions and what they do usually don&rsquo;t characterize what they are.</li>
<li>This is not the case for philosophers. What they choose for their
moral compass is the testimony of where their natures stand.</li>

German theologians love Kant using a means and his Synthetic judgment a priori. But none of these buy Nietzsches. The way Kant justifies the existence of a prior is at best cyclical. In Nietzsches&rsquo; view, the more pressing question to be answered is: why do we must believe an <em>a prior</em> to be true? The belief in &ldquo;Virtus Dormitiva&rdquo; is a mere antidote to the overwhelming sensualism overflowing in German.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Summary: Kant was proud of having discovered a new faculty in man, the faculty of synthetic judgment a priori, and the development of German philosophy was due to his pride. However, his answer to his own question of how synthetic judgments a priori were possible, was unsatisfactory. This led to a period of exuberant discovery of new faculties, which eventually gave way to a more sober view. The influence of German philosophy was due in part to its ability to provide an antidote to the sensualism of the previous century.</li>

<p>Table of Categories</p>
<p>Immanuel Kant&rsquo;s Table of Categories is a categorization of the twelve
fundamental concepts of the understanding (Verstand) that Kant
believed to be necessary for any meaningful experience. The Table of
Categories consists of four sets of three categories each,
representing the four primary functions of the understanding:
quantity, quality, relation, and modality.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Synthetic judgment a priori</p>
<p>Synthetic judgment a priori is a term used to refer to a type of
judgment that is based on an innate knowledge or ability of the human
mind. It is a judgment that does not rely on empirical evidence or
experience and is instead based purely on the logical reasoning of
the mind.</p>

<li>
<p>By means of a means (faculty)</p>
<ul>
<li>faculty refers to the mental powers or capabilities of an individual
or group, such as the ability to think, reason, or make decisions.</li>
<li>the most important faculty Nietzsches is unhappy about the faculty
of &ldquo;transcendental&rdquo;: the faculty allows one to have a direct,
intuitive understanding of the world beyond what can be seen and
experienced through physical senses. It&rsquo;s referred to by Schelling
as <strong>intellectual intuition</strong>, and is associated with a naturally pious
inclination.</li>
<li>Kant&rsquo;s idea was happily received by theologians belongs to the
Tubingen institution: The Tübingen School, also known as the
Tubingen institution was a German theological movement in the 19th
century that aimed to interpret the Bible in a historical-critical
manner. It was led by theologians such as Friedrich Schleiermacher,
Albrecht Ritschl, and Adolf von Harnack.</li>
<li>However, to Nietzsche, the claim of a &ldquo;by means of a means&rdquo; is a
cyclical statement. To demonstrate this point, he made an example of
a person asking a doctor, how opium induces sleep, and the
doctor answers, there&rsquo;s a power in it that induces sleep, and the
nature of that power is to make sense to become drowsy. It&rsquo;s
immediately seen that the statement lacks any substance in it but
only comical.</li>

<p>Virtus dormitiva</p>
<p>Virtus dormitiva is a Latin phrase meaning &ldquo;powers of sleep&rdquo;. It is
used to refer to a faculty or ability that induces sleep. In this
document, the author is suggesting that this faculty can be used to
achieve the desired effect which could be compared to a &ldquo;circulus
vitiosus deus&rdquo; (a vicious cycle of God).</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="sensualism">Sensualism</h4>
<p>Sensualism has its roots in the philosophies of ancient Greek
philosophers, who believed that the most reliable form of knowledge
was derived from the senses and feelings. This idea was further
developed by British Sensualists such as John Locke and David Hume,
and British Associationists including Thomas Brown, David Hartley, and
Joseph Priestley. Sensualism was also popularized by Victor Cousin,
who argued that the gratification of the senses was the highest
good. In the 19th century, sensualism was adopted by philosophers such
as Wilhelm Wundt, who proposed a scientific approach to sensualism
that could be applied to the study of language and cognition.</p>

<p>Pole Copernicus</p>
<p>Nicolaus Copernicus was a Renaissance-era astronomer who developed the

other planets revolve around the Sun. This contradicted the prevailing
geocentric model of the universe, which held that the Earth was the
center of the universe. He is also credited with being the first

them. Boscovich also suggested that the force of gravity is mediated

<p>Materialistic atomism is the theory that the universe is composed of

the ultimate source of all matter, energy, and forces.</p>

<p>Will to power</p>
<p>Friedrich Nietzsche&rsquo;s “will to power” is a concept which is central to
his writings. It is the idea that all people have a fundamental drive
to exert power and control over their environment and the people
around them. This concept is related to, but distinct from, the idea
of ambition or striving for success. According to Nietzsche, the will
to power is an all-encompassing and pervasive aspect of human nature
which underlies all other motivations and drives. It is an innate part
of human nature, and it is only through the will to power that we can
achieve any kind of progress or advancement. The will to power is a
controversial concept, and one that has been widely debated by
philosophers and psychologists.</p>

This passage discusses the difference between the two modes of thought in natural philosophy: the plebeian sensualism that relies on what can be seen and felt, and the aristocratic mode of thought of Plato, which resists sense-evidence and instead relies on pale, cold, grey conceptional networks. It suggests that the former approach may be more suitable for a hardy, laborious race of machinists and bridge-builders of the future, while the latter approach offers a different kind of enjoyment.</h4>

<p>Regulative hypothesis</p>
<p>The regulative hypothesis is a concept in the philosophy of science
which states that scientific inquiry should aim to discover laws that
regulate nature. This hypothesis seeks to explain why certain
scientific theories are accepted by scientists even though they may
lack empirical evidence. The hypothesis suggests that the pursuit of
such laws is a necessary part of scientific progress, as it allows
scientists to more accurately and effectively predict the behavior of
natural phenomena. The regulative hypothesis is closely related to the
principle of uniformity, which states that the laws of nature remain
the same over time and space.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But whoever considers the fundamental impulses of man with a view to determining how far they may have here acted as INSPIRING GENII (or as demons and cobolds), will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one time or another, and that each one of them would have been only too glad to look upon itself as the ultimate end of existence and the legitimate LORD over all the other impulses.
