The Strait of Hormuz is a narrow, strategically important waterway
located between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. It is the only
sea passage from the Persian Gulf to the open ocean and is one of the
world's most important oil chokepoints, with an estimated 21 million
barrels of oil passing through it daily.
