## What are China's geopolitical interests {#what-are-china-s-geopolitical-interests}

China's geopolitical interests include controlling access to the
[Strait of Malacca]({{< relref "strait-of-malacca" >}}), which provides access to the world's most important
shipping lanes in the South China Sea; controlling access to Tibet and
the Tibetan Plateau, which gives them access to the Tibetan sources of
three of China's great rivers, the Yellow, Yangtze, and Mekong;
controlling access to the oil, minerals, precious metals, and markets
of Africa; and maintaining amicable relations with Russia and other
states along the Strait of Malacca and the South China Sea, while also
protecting its territorial claims and interests in these regions.


## Why is Tibet strategically important to China's geopolitics {#why-is-tibet-strategically-important-to-china-s-geopolitics}

Tibet is strategically important to China's geopolitics due to its
location between India and China.

The Himalayas and Karakorum Range form a natural barrier along the
Chinese-Indian border, effectively blocking military and economic
contact between the two most populous countries in the world. This
'Great Wall' serves as an inescapable reminder of their separation.

By controlling Tibet, China can prevent India from having access to
it, and prevent India from basing military forces there, which would
give them the commanding heights, and a base from which india
might be able to push to the Chinese heartland. Additionally, Tibet is
home to the sources of three of China's great rivers, making it known
as "China's Water Tower". China needs to control Tibet in order to
ensure its access to these vital resources and protect their
security.


## China's geopolitical interests along the side of the Pacific {#china-s-geopolitical-interests-along-the-side-of-the-pacific}

The access to the Pacific from the coastal area of China has in
between the "First Island Chain"[^fn:1] and
"Nine-dash-line"[^fn:2]. Free access to the Pacific might not be a
 problem in peaceful times but can be fatal during wartime.


### East China Sea, conflicts with Japan {#east-china-sea-conflicts-with-japan}

1.  From the Yellow Sea rounding around the Korean Peninsula, going
    through the Sea of Japan and up through La Perouse Strait above
    Hokkaido, navigating through La Perouse Strait[^fn:3] and into the
    Pacific.

1.  The Diaoyu Island/Senkaku island dispute

The region matters to China's geopolitical interests for two reasons:

1.  They might want their ships to pass through the East China Sea off
    Shanghai, passing through Ryukyu Island which includes Okinawa,
    into the Pacific.

     The Americans have a military base around Okinawa when during
    conflicts, the Japanese can pile up as many shore-to-ship
    missiles&nbsp;[^fn:4] as they can.

2.  The newly found rich gas deposits in the East China Sea.

[^fn:1]: The First Island Chain is a defensive naval strategy employed by China to secure its maritime borders. It involves the creation of an archipelago of military bases and fortifications along a line of islands stretching from the Kuril Islands in the north to the Malay Archipelago in the south. The goal of the strategy is to protect China's territorial waters and prevent hostile powers from entering the region.

[^fn:2]: The Nine-Dash Line, also known as the Nine-Dotted Line, is a territorial demarcation line claimed by the People's Republic of China (PRC) in the South China Sea. It is the basis of the PRC's claim to nearly all of the waters and islands of the South China Sea, and is used by the PRC to justify its extensive territorial claims in the area.

[^fn:3]: The strait is currently claimed by Japan but controlled by Russia.
[^fn:4]: Shore-to-ship missiles are missiles that are launched from land-based sites, such as the tip of the Ryukyu Islands, towards ships in the sea. These missiles are used to protect the land-based site from naval attacks.
