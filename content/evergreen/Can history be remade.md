Inspired by Chapter 3 of [1984 - Orwell]({{< relref "#d41d8c" >}}), where Winston tries to
remember what happened to his family and what happened in the
past. However, the past was rewritten and the process of "rectifying"
the history was vividly depicted in Chapter 4. However, to have the
absolute power of dictate even the language requires real management
skills and also a set of conditions... I am curious how feasible it is
in real life and what are conditions needed to make it happens.
