## Iran {#iran}

{{< figure src="/images/Geopolitics_of_Middle_East/org_20221210-002452_screenshot.png" width="600px" >}}

Iran is a very mountainous country, which makes it hard to have an
economy with all the different parts connected. There are lots of
different minority groups living in Iran, each with its own culture
and language. For example, Khuzestan is mostly Arab, and there are
also Kurds, Azeri, Turkmen and Georgians. Most people in Iran speak
Farsi, which is the language of the Persian majority. Because of this
diversity, Iran's leaders have usually used military force and a
powerful security service to keep the country safe. Iran's leaders
know that no one is planning to attack them, but they also know that
other countries could use Iran's minorities to cause trouble and try
to change the government.


### Potential problem: nuclear weapons threatening other countries {#potential-problem-nuclear-weapons-threatening-other-countries}

Many countries, especially Israel, are afraid that Iran is trying to
build nuclear weapons which could cause a lot of tension in the
area. The Israelis are scared because if Iran gets nuclear weapons,
other countries in the region like Saudi Arabia might want to get them
too. This would mean that Iran would be the biggest and most powerful
country in the region. To prevent this, the Saudis might try to buy
nuclear weapons from Pakistan. Israel might try to stop this from
happening by sending a plane to attack Iran's nuclear facilities, but
this would be very difficult because it is a long way away, and it
would also risk angering Iraq and other countries in the area. Another
problem is that Iran could close the [Strait of Hormuz]({{< relref "strait-of-hormuz" >}}) which could
cause problems for the whole world. That's why so many countries are
trying to stop Israel from attacking Iran.


### Geopolitical Friends and Enemies {#geopolitical-friends-and-enemies}

-   Friends
    -Iraq: the US delivered Shia-majority government
-   Enemy
    -   Saudi Arabia: the Summo-dominated government
        Under the dictatorship of Saddam, the Iraq is a powerful buffer
        zone between Saudi Arabia and Iran, but now the buffer zone is
        gone.
    -   US: they used to fear the encirclement by the Americans from Iraq
        and Afghanistan, but now the fear is gone.


## Turkey {#turkey}


### Why EU won't accept it as a member country {#why-eu-won-t-accept-it-as-a-member-country}


#### Geography {#geography}

If Turkey is part of Europe, then Europe's borders would reach
to Syria, Iraq and Iran.

Only 5% of the territory of Turkey is considered inside of the
Europe. (West of the Bosporus[^fn:1]), the rest are considered
in the middle east.


#### Demographic {#demographic}

The disparity in living standard and 75m population. The EU
countries are afraid of the influx of labour force from Turkey.


#### Other potential issues {#other-potential-issues}

-   Human right issues, especially towards the Kurd.
-   Religion: the majority of the population is Muslim.


### [ ] To what extent did the refusal from the EU result in the reemergence of religious leaders since Mustafa Kemal[^fn:2]? {#to-what-extent-did-the-refusal-from-the-eu-result-in-the-reemergence-of-religious-leaders-since-mustafa-kemal}

In the book [Prisoner of Geography]({{< relref "marshallPrisonersGeographyTen2015#prisoner-of-geography" >}}), the author brought up that
continued rejection from the EU, plus the refusal of many Turks to
become secularized resulted in Turkish politicians seeking "Plan B",
the alternative to becoming a secularized culturally European country.

There was religious president Turgut Özal[^fn:3] came to the office
and wanted to make Turkey the great land bridge between Europe, Asia
and the Middle East, a country that has great power in all three
regions. This is also the vision under the current President Recep
Tayyip Erdoğan[^fn:4].

However, it is also the geography of the country that makes the dream
hard to be fulfilled.


### Relationship with other regional countries {#relationship-with-other-regional-countries}


#### With Arab Countries: icy and cooled {#with-arab-countries-icy-and-cooled}

Arab countries are generally suspicious of Turkey's plan to
revive the Ottoman's glory economically.

-   Iran: sees Turkey as the most important competitor bother
    economically and militarily in its backyard. The relationship cooled
    after the Syrian civil war[^fn:5], for they are backing opposite
    sides of the factions.
-   Egypt: the Muslim brotherhood policy failed after the second military
    coup in Egypt, and the relationship between Cairo and Ankara become
    icy. They even become the major customer of the new energy source
    created by the alliance between Cyprus, Greece and Israel.


#### Israel: cold war relation {#israel-cold-war-relation}

-   [ ] fill the Turkey and Israel conflict with more details later.

The deterioration of relations between Israel and Turkey after the
ascendancy of the Justice and Development Party (AKP). The Israel-Gaza
conflict brings a good diplomatic relationship between Turkey and
Israel to a halt.&nbsp;[^fn:6]

Israel, Cyprus, and Greece are working together to get energy from the
gas fields near their coasts. Turkey could have gotten energy from
Israel, if their relationships are more reconciliatory. However,
because of the strained diplomatic relationship, they are still
relying on Russia for their energy needs. They are also working with
Russia builds pipelines so they can get the energy to other
countries in Europe.


#### NATO and US {#nato-and-us}

The US wants a better relationship between the Turkey and Israel to
strengthen NATO's position in the eastern Mediterranean.
Turkey is a key country to NATO because it controls the Bosporus
strait&nbsp;[^fn:1] - the entrance from the Black Sea to the
Mediterranean. Except for that, there is the Dardanelles Straits[^fn:7],
which is between the Sea of Marmara and the Aegean Sea&nbsp;[^fn:1], the Russian
fleets will have to navigate through if they want to get to the Aegean Sea
en route to the Mediterranean.

[^fn:1]: The Bosporus or Bosphorus is a narrow, natural strait and an
    internationally significant waterway located in northwestern
    Turkey. It is one of the Turkish Straits, along with the
    Dardanelles. It forms part of the boundary between Europe and Asia,
    and separates the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara.
