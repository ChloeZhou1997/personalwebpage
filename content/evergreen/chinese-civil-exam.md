-   [ ] How did the Chinese Civil Examinations spread toward the west and how
    did it change the political landscape of the west?
-   [ ] The bureaucratic problem created because of the civil service
    system? Or Civil service system can be seperated from the
    bureaucratic structure of the Chinese political system?
-   [ ] The problem created because of the Civil Exam? E.g., talented
    people wasted their talents to become bureaucrats. (Even though
    people in China like to say they have a competitive margin in
    management due to its long tradition of managing a huge empire,
    modern management didn't emerge from China either).
-   [ ] Even though there were scholars like Huang Zongxi in Chinese
    pre-modern history, he never questioned the legitimacy of the
    emperor. Does the lack of questioning higher authority in Chinese
    history have anything to do with the Chinese civil exam system? (Or
    putting the civil exam system in a bigger context, the Confucious
    society)


## History of Chinese Civil Examinations {#history-of-chinese-civil-examinations}

-   [ ] Including information from Qianmu's _Analysis of the political
    system of Dynastic China_


### The foundation: Zhou Dynasty (ca. 1100â€“256 BCE) {#the-foundation-zhou-dynasty--ca-dot-1100-256-bce}

Although many believed that the Zhou Dynasty wrote texts that
served as the foundation for the system of civil service
examinations, it has since been shown that these texts were
reconstructions written in the first centuries BCE. The Zhou
Dynasty is part of the Three Dynasties of Antiquity, which is seen
as a golden age in which the key elements of civilization were
created and served as models for later Chinese
polities. Therefore, the institutional history of the civil
service examinations predates the Three Dynasties.


### Han Dynasty? {#han-dynasty}


### Sui(581-618) and Tang(618-907): the pattern for later dynasties were established by Empress Wu {#sui--581-618--and-tang--618-907--the-pattern-for-later-dynasties-were-established-by-empress-wu}

The examinations were used to both promote and assign posts to those
already serving, as well as to those who had been recommended for
office.

The civil examinations were institutionalized during this period
of time. One of the reasons the emperors love this system is it
helps to reduce the power of aristocratic families who had strong
political power in the previous five centuries.

This motive can be best seen in the reign of Empress Wu, who
claimed the thrown after oversaw two of her sons. She relied on
the examinations to recruit more new officials than any of her
predecessors. Successful examination candidates attained the
highest positions in the bureaucracy, allowing Empress Wu to gain
more control over her reign.


### Song (960-1276): the examination process becomes competitive {#song--960-1276--the-examination-process-becomes-competitive}

-   New rulers opted to select officials based on a competitive
    process and not solely on family pedigree or wealth.

-   pushed the use of the examinations further as part of the
    rulers' attempt to curb the power of the regional military
    commanders and powerful families

-   In the early period, still more people entered the officialdom[^fn:2]
    through recommendations from powerful patrons or inheriting
    positions from family connections than from examinations.

-   The number of candidates attending the Song qualifying
    prefectural examinations[^fn:3] increased from 20k to 400k from
    early 11th century to mid-13th century, by the end, the
    estimated population is about 50m.


#### After Song {#after-song}

-   The exams were the most important way to get a job in the
    government. People who did the best on the exams got the best
    jobs.

-   The number of candidates grew at **exponential rates**, and the
    overall numbers continues to increase during Ming(1368-1644) and
    Qing dynasty(1644-1911). The increase in the number of candidates
    corresponds to the demographic trend.

-   By 1850, the number of candidates for the local examinations had
    increased to about 2m out of a population of 430m.

-   However, during the period when the state coffers were depleted
    (As in Qing dynasty), to take the exams, people had to
    prove that they had a good family background. As more and more
    people took the exams and competed for official positions, more
    people received titles and jobs through their family connections
    or by buying them instead of getting them through the exams.


## The impact of the Civil Service Exam on Chinese political, social and intellectual life in pre-twentieth-century China {#the-impact-of-the-civil-service-exam-on-chinese-political-social-and-intellectual-life-in-pre-twentieth-century-china}


### On Social Reproduction[^fn:4] and Social Mobility {#on-social-reproduction-and-social-mobility}

There were quantitative research suggesting the number of
successful examination candidates, over 50% in the Southern Song,
49.5% in the Ming and 37.6% in the Qing came from families with no
immediate patrilineal forefathers in the bureaucracy. However,
even though the examinations were supposed to be open to everyone,
many people were excluded from taking them, such as monks and
priests, beggars, sons of prostitutes, craftsmen, clerks, and
merchants. Also, even if someone managed to take the exams, their
success was still strongly influenced by their family
background. This means that if someone's family was wealthy and
powerful, they had a better chance of doing well in the exams. So,
even though the exams were supposed to offer people a chance to
move up in society, it was still very hard for people from
underprivileged backgrounds to do this.


### On Creating New Social Group {#on-creating-new-social-group}

The civil exam system creates demands for instructions on how to
prepare for the various genre tests. People who happen to meet the
demands tend to be those who prepared for it themselves. This
creates a self-sustaining loop and creates the empire-wide social
group "literati".[^fn:5] This was called 'early modern literate
industriousness'[^fn:6] which means that these people worked hard to
become educated.


## What did the Europeans learn from the Chinese Civil Examination system? {#what-did-the-europeans-learn-from-the-chinese-civil-examination-system}

[^fn:1]: This [article](https://inference-review.com/article/the-chinese-civil-examinations) has a brief section on the historical development
    of China's civil exam system. The interesting part is the
    investigation of the curriculum of the exam but the article doesn't
    really have a critical analysis on why it keeps on attracting more
    candidates despite the declining odds of success.
[^fn:2]: Officialdom is the collective body of officials and government
    agents that operate within a system of government, typically with the
    purpose of carrying out administrative tasks and enforcing laws and
    regulations.
[^fn:3]: Prefectural examinations refer to examinations administered at
    the prefectural level, which are the highest level of examinations
    administered at the provincial level and which require candidates to
    travel to the provincial and metropolitan centers of political
    power. These examinations are the final step in the examination
    process and are typically administered and evaluated by the imperial
    court or bureaucracy.
[^fn:4]: the examinations were supposed to be open to everyone, many
    people were excluded from taking them, such as monks and priests,
    beggars, sons of prostitutes, craftsmen, clerks, and merchants. It
    also says that even if someone managed to take the exams, their
    success was still strongly influenced by their family background. This
    means that if someone's family was wealthy and powerful, they had a
    better chance of doing well in the exams. So, even though the exams
    were supposed to offer people a chance to move up in society, it was
    still very hard for people from underprivileged backgrounds to do
    this.
[^fn:5]: The literati were a special group of people who were not just
    literate, but also had a lot of knowledge about written and physical
    cultures, languages, and social customs. This group was connected to
    each other in a way that was unique compared to other groups in
    Chinese history. People who took part in the exams were part of this
    group. As the wealth of the Chinese territories increased, especially
    in the southeast, more people wanted to take the exams. But the
    Chinese government wanted to keep the number of people who passed the
    exams low, so the chances of passing were very slim. In some places,
    only 1 in 200 people managed to pass the exams. This was much harder
    than any modern exam or grant competition.
[^fn:6]: A term coined by Des Forges, a French literary scholar and
    historian. She is best known for her work on early modern literature
    and culture, specifically
