Geographical features that influence international relations and
global policy decisions include physical landscapes such as mountains,
deserts, rivers, jungles, lakes, and seas; climate; demographics;
cultural regions; access to natural resources; power to defend land;
air power; the internet; nation-forming; the Arctic; rivers and river
networks; the Hindu Kush and the Himalayas; the rainy season; limited
access to natural minerals or food sources; the legacy of colonial
powers; and the technological genius and power projection of the last
superpower standing.
