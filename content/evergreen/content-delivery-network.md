## What is CDN {#what-is-cdn}

A content delivery network (CDN) is a group of geographically
distributed servers that speed up the delivery of web content by
bringing it closer to where users are. Data centers across the globe
use caching, a process that temporarily stores copies of files, so
that you can access internet content from a web-enabled device or
browser more quickly through a server near you. CDNs cache content
like web pages, images, and video in proxy servers near to your
physical location. This allows you to do things like watch a movie,
download software, check your bank balance, post on social media, or
make purchases, without having to wait for content to load.
