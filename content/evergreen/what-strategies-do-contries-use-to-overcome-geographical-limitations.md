Countries can use a variety of strategies to overcome geographical
limitations. These can include utilizing technology to bridge physical
distances, focusing foreign policy on regions that are more accessible
and utilizing air and naval power to project power beyond their
physical borders. They can also take advantage of existing
geographical features, such as rivers and navigable seas, to
facilitate trade and transportation. Additionally, countries may
attempt to adjust their borders or create new ones to better manage
their resources or protect their populations.
