Technology has had a major impact on how countries interact with each
other. For example, advances in communication technologies such as the
internet, have made it easier for people to connect and share
information across countries, allowing for faster and more efficient
collaborations. In addition, advances in transportation technologies
have enabled countries to interact more easily and quickly, allowing
for increased trade, diplomatic exchanges, and travel. Finally,
technology has also enabled countries to bridge the physical barriers
that previously existed, such as the Himalayas and the Sahara Desert,
which have historically separated nations and limited their ability to
interact with each other.
