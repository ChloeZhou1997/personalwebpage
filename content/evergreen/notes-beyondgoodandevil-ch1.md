## 1 . Nietzsche starts the first chapter of the book by questioning the "Will of Truth" - if there's a will to truth, why not untruth? {#1-dot-nietzsche-starts-the-first-chapter-of-the-book-by-questioning-the-will-of-truth-if-there-s-a-will-to-truth-why-not-untruth}

Nietzsche pointed that philosophers devoted themselves to the "Will of
Truth" without questioning the origin of the will. He also mentioned
such question is _Dangerous_.

-   [ ] Will of Truth? (Who is the one that coined the term? What makes
    Nietzsche opens the book with the investigation of this idea?)


## 2. The fundamental belief of metaphysicians is _the belief in antitheses of values_. Metaphysicians hold no doubt of this presupposition. Venturing into questioning such belief is dangerous but inevitable. {#2-dot-the-fundamental-belief-of-metaphysicians-is-the-belief-in-antitheses-of-values-dot-metaphysicians-hold-no-doubt-of-this-presupposition-dot-venturing-into-questioning-such-belief-is-dangerous-but-inevitable-dot}

-   Nietzsche questions the fundamental belief in metaphysics, that

things cannot originate from their opposition. The highest values must come
into being.

-   If we venture to question such belief: virtues might steam from
    vise. The fundamental values of life might be attributed to the
    pretense, the will to deception etc.
-   Nietzsche believes that such investigation is inevitable and is
    immerging.


### Need further investigation <code>[0/1]</code> {#need-further-investigation}

-   [ ] What's the meaning of _antitheses of values_?
    -   Personal understanding: The dichotomy of values, things are either
        good or bad, true or untrue but not in between. And there is no room for things
        might be in between, or fostering each other... That's why build
        from this Nietzsche criticizes the foundation the philosophy is
        built upon - a truth that is absolute and unarguable, built from
        the philosopher's own prejudice.
