## 1. Nietzsche starts the first chapter of the book by questioning the "Will of Truth" - if there's a will to truth, why not untruth? {#1-dot-nietzsche-starts-the-first-chapter-of-the-book-by-questioning-the-will-of-truth-if-there-s-a-will-to-truth-why-not-untruth}

Nietzsche pointed that philosophers devoted themselves to the "Will of Truth" without questioning the origin of the will. He also mentioned such question is _Dangerous_.


### Sphnix and Oedipus {#sphnix-and-oedipus}

[Sphnix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphinx) is a mythical creature with a head of a human, the body of a lion and the wings of a falcon. According to legend, he's guarded the Greek city of Thebes and fond of asking riddles to travelers. However, Oedipus was able to solve all the riddles Sphnix gave, Sphnix threw herself from her high rock and died.


### The Will to Truth {#the-will-to-truth}

The tendency to seek out and believe in the truth even in hard circumstances. (But whether it is the truth that people are seeking, or a desire to believe something as truth/good?)


## 2. The fundamental belief of metaphysicians is _the belief in antitheses of values_. Metaphysicians hold no doubt of this presupposition. Venturing into questioning such belief is dangerous but inevitable. {#2-dot-the-fundamental-belief-of-metaphysicians-is-the-belief-in-antitheses-of-values-dot-metaphysicians-hold-no-doubt-of-this-presupposition-dot-venturing-into-questioning-such-belief-is-dangerous-but-inevitable-dot}

-   Nietzsche questions the fundamental belief in metaphysics, that things cannot originate from their opposition. The highest values must come into being.
-   If we venture to question such belief: virtues might steam from vise. The fundamental values of life might be attributed to the pretense, the will to deception etc.
-   Nietzsche believes that such investigation is inevitable and is immerging.


### Need further investigation <code>[0/1]</code> {#need-further-investigation}

-   [ ] What's the meaning of _antitheses of values_?
    -   Personal understanding: The dichotomy of values, things are either good or bad, true or untrue but not in between. And there is no room for things might be in between, or fostering each other... That's why build from this Nietzsche criticizes the foundation the philosophy is built upon - a truth that is absolute and unarguable, built from the philosopher's own prejudice.


## 3. The assertion of being conscious of thinking and unaffected by physical condition and value is only an illusion and is maintained to have a definite mode of life. {#3-dot-the-assertion-of-being-conscious-of-thinking-and-unaffected-by-physical-condition-and-value-is-only-an-illusion-and-is-maintained-to-have-a-definite-mode-of-life-dot}


### Need further investigation <code>[1/2]</code> {#need-further-investigation}

-   [ ] Where do all the assertions that philosophical thinking is not free from instinctive and decisive sense stem from? Up to this point, the three points seem to talk about the same thing...
-   [X] What's the meaning of "measure of things" at the end of the paragraph?
    -   Suppose a man is not the _measure of things_: the measure of things means the standard by which everything else is measured. Here, Nietzsche tries to ask people to suppose maybe man is not the standard by which everything else is measured...


## 4. The usual falseness of opinion needs little doubt, what matter is to find the opinions that are life-furthering and species-raring. What we are undoubled about so far is only a negation of life and to recognize the untruth is the movement that places itself beyond good and evil. {#4-dot-the-usual-falseness-of-opinion-needs-little-doubt-what-matter-is-to-find-the-opinions-that-are-life-furthering-and-species-raring-dot-what-we-are-undoubled-about-so-far-is-only-a-negation-of-life-and-to-recognize-the-untruth-is-the-movement-that-places-itself-beyond-good-and-evil-dot}


## 5. The reason people tend to distrust and make fun of philosophers is not because they keep making innocent mistakes or because they seem childish, but because philosophers are not honest about their opinions. Instead of admitting that they might be biased, philosophers pretend that their opinions are based on a logical, reasoning process when really they are just defending their own prejudices. {#5-dot-the-reason-people-tend-to-distrust-and-make-fun-of-philosophers-is-not-because-they-keep-making-innocent-mistakes-or-because-they-seem-childish-but-because-philosophers-are-not-honest-about-their-opinions-dot-instead-of-admitting-that-they-might-be-biased-philosophers-pretend-that-their-opinions-are-based-on-a-logical-reasoning-process-when-really-they-are-just-defending-their-own-prejudices-dot}

-   Nietzsche mocked both Kant and Spinoza for their philosophy. For Kant, it's his dialetics that leads to categorical imperative; for Spinoza, it's his claims for embedded the mathematical form in his philosophy, and called it "hocuspocus"... (he only used them to scare people away for he himself is not confident about he's thought)


### [Tartuffery] of old Kant {#tartuffery-of-old-kant}

-   Tartuffery is the practice of pretending to be virtuous or holy in order to deceive others. The term is often used to refer to religious hypocrisy.


### categorical imperative (绝对律令) {#categorical-imperative--绝对律令}

-   Imperative: absolute command or order
-   The categorical imperative is an ethical principle developed by Kant. It states that an action is morally good if it can be willed as a universal law, i.e. if it could be applied to everyone without leading to a contradiction.


## 6. To understand a difficult metaphysical assertion from a philsopher, one only needs to figure out what morality the philosopher is aiming at. For it's the moral purpose of the philosopher that dictates the shape his philosophy will eventually grow in. There's nothing in philosophy that is absolutely impersonal. {#6-dot-to-understand-a-difficult-metaphysical-assertion-from-a-philsopher-one-only-needs-to-figure-out-what-morality-the-philosopher-is-aiming-at-dot-for-it-s-the-moral-purpose-of-the-philosopher-that-dictates-the-shape-his-philosophy-will-eventually-grow-in-dot-there-s-nothing-in-philosophy-that-is-absolutely-impersonal-dot}

How did he work up to this conclusion?

-   Nietzsche doesn't believe in the "impulse to knowledge" as the
    father of philosophy. Instead the impulse to knowledge steam from
    the need to use them as a tool.
-   However, he believes whoever thinks of himself as creative and
    inspiring and certainly possesses that "impulse" are certainly
    willing to consider themselves superior to others as it's what
    impulse does - imperious and hence tend to "philosophize".
-   Unlike scientific scholars, even though most of their impulses might
    be driven by material interests, there might be a tiny bit of
    interests that are purely driven by curiosity and the genuine
    interest itself. And the fact that most of the interests are in
    money making or family, is what makes it impersonal. For the
    actions and what they do usually don't characterize what they are.
-   This is not the case for philosophers. What they choose for their
    moral compass is the testimony of where their natures stand.


### Need further investigation <code>[0/1]</code> {#need-further-investigation}

-   [ ] In Ch1-6, Nietzsche said the "impulse" is imperious and tends to
    philosophize itself. What does making philosophy do with **impulse**?
    (see quote&nbsp;[^fn:1])

[^fn:1]: "But whoever considers the fundamental impulses of man with a view to determining how far they may have here acted as INSPIRING GENII (or as demons and cobolds), will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one time or another, and that each one of them would have been only too glad to look upon itself as the ultimate end of existence and the legitimate LORD over all the other impulses. For every impulse is imperious, and as SUCH, attempts to philosophize."
