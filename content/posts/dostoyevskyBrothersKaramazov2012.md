## Motivation for reading {#motivation-for-reading}

Heavily referenced in Camus' _Rabel_.


## Memo Quote {#memo-quote}

-   Ivan's view of the physical world and religion

> I have a Euclidian earthly mind, and how could I solve problems that are not of this world? And I advise you never to think about it either, my dear Alyosha, especially about God, whether He exists or not. All such questions are utterly inappropriate for a mind created with an idea of only three dimensions. And so I accept God and am glad to, and what’s more, I accept His wisdom, His purpose—which are utterly beyond our ken; I believe in the underlying order and the meaning of life; I believe in the eternal harmony in which they say we shall one day be blended. I believe in the Word to Which the universe is striving, and Which Itself was ‘with God,’ and Which Itself is God and so on, and so on, to infinity.


## Background {#background}


## Impression {#impression}

-   Chracters are very complicated. Even the "bad" one by convension
    seems to have a noble heart while people who are professional and by
    current standard, only merely try to do their works right, somehow
    seems mediocor to the point of evil.
