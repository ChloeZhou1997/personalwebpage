### <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2022-11-16 Wed&gt; </span></span> : Reading Progress : 1% {#reading-progress-1}

-   I was attempated to read it faster then realize I can't understand
    anything if reading at that pace... So my current goal is to read at
    least one section a day and build a more solid understanding of the
    book.


### <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2022-11-16 Wed&gt; </span></span> : Reading Progress : 2% {#reading-progress-2}

    but not from evil more destructive motives... but I don't understand
    the meaning of the _antithesis of value_ so I am very confused about
    the paragraph...
