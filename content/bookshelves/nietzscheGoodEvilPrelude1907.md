## Motivation for reading {#motivation-for-reading}

He's the one that paved the way for existentialism, and he's work is heavily referenced in Camus'
work... I have long wanted to read about him.


## Background {#background}


## Memo Quote {#memo-quote}


### Ch1-3 {#ch1-3}

> As little as the act of birth comes into consideration in the whole process and procedure of heredity, just as little is “being-conscious” as opposed to the instinctive in any decisive sense; the greater part of the conscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly influenced by his instincts, and forced into definite channels. And behind all logic and its seeming sovereignty of movement, there are valuations, or to speak more plainly, physiological demands, for the maintenance of a definite mode of life.


### Ch1-4 {#ch1-4}

> To recognize untruth as a condition of life; is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas of value in a dangerous manner, and a philosophy that ventures to do so, has thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil.


### Ch1-6 {#ch1-6}

> In the philosopher, on the contrary, there is absolutely nothing impersonal; and above all, his morality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony as to who he is,—that is to say, in what order the deepest impulses of his nature stand to each other.

-   I guess it's universally true for everyone, not only for
    philosophers. That a person's morality shows where his true nature
    stands...


## Ch1-9 {#ch1-9}

```emacs-lisp
this is an old and everlasting story: what happened in old times with the Stoics still happens today, as soon as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always creates the world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise; philosophy is this tyrannical impulse itself, the most spiritual Will to Power, the will to "creation of the world," the will to the causa prima.
```

-   Philosophy is the "will to power", the impulse to "creation of the
    world", and the will to the cause of all causes. (Isn't it the will
    to the truth even though it probably only is the creation of its own
    imagery? )


## Impression {#impression}

-   Nietzsche seems particularly unsatisfied with Kant's philosophy of morality (which is

absolute)... see [quote](#reading-progress-3).


## Reading log {#reading-log}


### <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2022-11-22 Tue&gt; </span></span> : Reading Progress : 5% {#reading-progress-5}

-   This passage (ch1-10) is too hard to understand T-T


### <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2022-11-21 Mon&gt; </span></span> : Reading Progress : 5% {#reading-progress-5}

-   Nietzsche turns to Stoics...


### <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2022-11-20 Sun&gt; </span></span> : Reading Progress : 4% {#reading-progress-4}

-   Nietzsche turns his criticism on Greek philosophers.


### <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2022-11-19 Sat&gt; </span></span> : Reading Progress : 4% {#reading-progress-4}

-   The 6th point consists of a long sentence and is so hard to
    understand...


### <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2022-11-19 Sat&gt; </span></span> : Reading Progress : 3% {#reading-progress-3}

> The spectacle of the Tartuffery of old Kant, equally stiff and decent, with which he entices us into the dialectic by-ways that lead (more correctly mislead) to his “categorical imperative”—makes us fastidious ones smile, we who find no small amusement in spying out the subtle tricks of old moralists and ethical preachers.


### <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2022-11-18 Fri&gt; </span></span> : Reading Progress : 3% {#reading-progress-3}

-   Nietzsche points out that thinks are not sovereign in movement and
    any seemingly logical deduction are not free from value judgement,
-   _To recognize the untruth as a condition of life_...


### <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2022-11-16 Wed&gt; </span></span> : Reading Progress : 2% {#reading-progress-2}

-   Ch1S2, Nietzsches questions why the values have to steam from good
    but not from evil more destructive motives... but I don't understand
    the meaning of the _antithesis of value_ so I am very confused about
    the paragraph...


### <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2022-11-16 Wed&gt; </span></span> : Reading Progress : 1% {#reading-progress-1}

-   I was attempted to read it faster then realize I can't understand
    anything if reading at that pace... So my current goal is to read at
    least one section a day and build a more solid understanding of the
    book.
