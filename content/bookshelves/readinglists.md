I am a heavy reader who loves reading about philosophy, history and
politics. I also love classic literature a lot. Sometimes I read
reviews, analyses and background stories that relate to the pieces I
am reading and the desire to put all those dots together motivates me
to create this site in the first place.

This page is dedicated to the list of books and articles I have read and currently
reading that I find inspiring and interesting.


## Reading {#reading}

## Things left undone {#things-left-undone}

-   [ ] figuring out how to get the info from douban and goodread...
-   [ ] check whether export works.
-   [ ] Reference to files only works when it's in the path of the post


## Plan for the page {#plan-for-the-page}

-   [ ] Statistics of the books I have read
-   [ ] Short reviews on the book, links to bookreview site
-   [ ] Filter (Maybe in conjunction with JS)
-   [ ] Change the interface to make it looks not like another blog post
-   [ ] find a way to export it to name `index.md`
