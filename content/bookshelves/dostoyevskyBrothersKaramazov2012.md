Heavily referenced in Camus' _Rabel_.

### Ivan's view of the physical world and religion {#ivan-s-view-of-the-physical-world-and-religion}

> I have a Euclidian earthly mind, and how could I solve problems that are not of this world? And I advise you never to think about it either, my dear Alyosha, especially about God, whether He exists or not. All such questions are utterly inappropriate for a mind created with an idea of only three dimensions. And so I accept God and am glad to, and what’s more, I accept His wisdom, His purpose—which are utterly beyond our ken; I believe in the underlying order and the meaning of life; I believe in the eternal harmony in which they say we shall one day be blended. I believe in the Word to Which the universe is striving, and Which Itself was ‘with God,’ and Which Itself is God and so on, and so on, to infinity.


### The Grand Inquisitor {#the-grand-inquisitor}

I am so fancinated by Ivan. He holds view totally in opposition to
Dostoevsky himself and yet Ivan's arguments are fantasitic and
penerating. Dostoevsky knows all the problems of mankind but still
decides a life without spiritual freedom doesn't worthwhile.

-   The inquisitor wants Him to redecide whether Him or the one who
    questioned him was right:


#### Most man's nature are weak, they want earthily bread and can't handle freedom {#most-man-s-nature-are-weak-they-want-earthily-bread-and-can-t-handle-freedom}

> “You want to go into the world, and you are going empty-handed,
> with some promise of freedom, which they in their simplicity and
> innate lawlessness cannot even comprehend, which they dread and
> fear—for nothing has ever been more insufferable for man and for
> human society than freedom! But do you see these stones in this
> bare, scorching desert? Turn them into bread and mankind will run
> after you like sheep, grateful and obedient, though eternally
> trembling lest you withdraw your hand and your loaves cease for
> them.” But you did not want to deprive man of freedom and
> rejected the offer, for what sort of freedom is it, you reasoned,
> if obedience is bought with loaves of bread?  You objected that

In simple term: the paragraph says: The people cannot take care of
themselves without us. They can't get enough food if they stay
free. Eventually, they will give up their freedom and ask us to take
care of them and give them food. They will understand that freedom and
enough food for everyone are not possible. Even if many people follow
us for the promise of heavenly food, what about the millions of other
people who can't give up their earthly food? We care about the weak
people too. They may be bad and disobedient, but in the end they will
obey us. They will think of us as gods because we are willing to give
up freedom and lead them. We will have to lie to them and say we are
doing it in your name. This will be our punishment because we have to
be dishonest.

#### Man is not God, nor the son of God, they won't remain faithful once they  are granted with freedom {#man-is-not-god-nor-the-son-of-god-they-won-t-remain-faithful-once-they-are-granted-with-freedom}

#### Man want's miracles more than they want God, hence once they reject the miracles, they will at once reject God as well. {#man-want-s-miracles-more-than-they-want-god-hence-once-they-reject-the-miracles-they-will-at-once-reject-god-as-well-dot}

## Background {#background}


## Impression {#impression}

-   Characters are very complicated. If someone sees a person like Demitri in
    real life, no doubt he will be treated like a buffoon. However,
    the character in the book sometimes displays insights into certain
    issues and also seems to possess a noble heart.
-   Love is a frequent theme in Dostoyevsky's work, if not the most
    frequent...

-   A very exciting confrontation between the prosecutor and the defender.
-   Love the state of what qualifies a person to be a true father.

> the father is not merely he who begets the child, but he who begets it and does his duty by it.

-   Smerdyakov kills himself
-   Ivan was in delirium and believed Smerdyakov mocked him before he
    committed suicide

-   Kolya's conversation with Alyosha (he respects him)
-   Dmitri's conversation with Alyosha (again, shows he's passionate
    personality and noble heart)

> It’s God that’s worrying me. That’s the only thing that’s worrying me. What if He doesn’t exist? What if Rakitin’s right—that it’s an idea made up by men? Then if He doesn’t exist, man is the chief of the earth, of the universe. Magnificent! Only how is he going to be good without God? That’s the question. I always come back to that. For whom is man going to love then? To whom will he be thankful? To whom will he sing the hymn? Rakitin laughs. Rakitin says that one can love humanity without God. Well, only a sniveling idiot can maintain that. I can’t understand it. Life’s easy for Rakitin. ‘You’d better think about the extension of civic rights, or even of keeping down the price of meat. You will show your love for humanity more simply and directly by that, than by philosophy.’ I answered him, ‘Well, but you, without a God, are more likely to raise the price of meat, if it suits you, and make a rouble on every kopeck.’ He lost his temper. But after all, what is goodness? Answer me that, Alexey. Goodness is one thing with me and another with a Chinaman, so it’s a relative thing. Or isn’t it? Is it not relative? ..."

-   Alyosha's conversation with Lise about evil is very interesting! The
    love of crime.

> "...There are moments when people love crime,” said Alyosha thoughtfully. “Yes, yes! You have uttered my thought; they love crime, every one loves crime, they love it always, not at some ‘moments.’ You know, it’s as though people have made an agreement to lie about it and have lied about it ever since. They all declare that they hate evil, but secretly they all love it.”

-   At the point where Smerdyakov is having the second conversation with
    Ivan and Ivan is suspecting he's the real killer of Fyodor Karamazov.

Dmitri can't defend himself to be innocent and was put into prison.
Kolya went to see Illusha and brought him back the dogs.
The conversation between Kolya and the Peasant is hilarious.

> “Nothing could stop me, now I am once off. Hey, good morning,
> peasant!” A sturdy-looking peasant, with a round, simple face and
> grizzled beard, who was walking by, raised his head and looked at the
> boy. He seemed not quite sober.
> “Good morning, if you are not laughing at me,” he said deliberately in
> reply.
> “And if I am?” laughed Kolya.
> “Well, a joke’s a joke. Laugh away. I don’t mind. There’s no harm in a joke.”
> “I beg your pardon, brother, it was a joke.”
> “Well, God forgive you!”
> “Do you forgive me, too?”
> “I quite forgive you. Go along.”
> “I say, you seem a clever peasant.”
> “Cleverer than you,” the peasant answered unexpectedly, with the same gravity. “I doubt it,”
> said Kolya, somewhat taken aback.
> “It’s true, though.” “Perhaps it is.”
> “It is, brother.”
> “Good-bye, peasant!”
> “Good-bye!”
> “There are all sorts of peasants,” Kolya observed to Smurov after a brief
> silence. “How could I tell I had hit on a clever one? I am always
> ready to recognise intelligence in the peasantry.”
