## Motivation for reading {#motivation-for-reading}

Heavily referenced in Camus' _Rabel_.


## Memo Quote {#memo-quote}

-   Ivan's view of the physical world and religion

> I have a Euclidian earthly mind, and how could I solve problems that are not of this world? And I advise you never to think about it either, my dear Alyosha, especially about God, whether He exists or not. All such questions are utterly inappropriate for a mind created with an idea of only three dimensions. And so I accept God and am glad to, and what’s more, I accept His wisdom, His purpose—which are utterly beyond our ken; I believe in the underlying order and the meaning of life; I believe in the eternal harmony in which they say we shall one day be blended. I believe in the Word to Which the universe is striving, and Which Itself was ‘with God,’ and Which Itself is God and so on, and so on, to infinity.


## Background {#background}


## Impression {#impression}

-   Characters are very complicated. If someone sees a person like Demitri in
    real life, no doubt he will be treated like a buffoon. However,
    the character in the book sometimes displays insights into certain
    issues and also seems to possess a noble heart.

-   Kolya's conversation with Alyosha (he respects him)
-   Dmitri's conversation with Alyosha (again, shows he's passionate
    personality and noble heart)

> It’s God that’s worrying me. That’s the only thing that’s worrying me. What if He doesn’t exist? What if Rakitin’s right—that it’s an idea made up by men? Then if He doesn’t exist, man is the chief of the earth, of the universe. Magnificent! Only how is he going to be good without God? That’s the question. I always come back to that. For whom is man going to love then? To whom will he be thankful? To whom will he sing the hymn? Rakitin laughs. Rakitin says that one can love humanity without God. Well, only a sniveling idiot can maintain that. I can’t understand it. Life’s easy for Rakitin. ‘You’d better think about the extension of civic rights, or even of keeping down the price of meat. You will show your love for humanity more simply and directly by that, than by philosophy.’ I answered him, ‘Well, but you, without a God, are more likely to raise the price of meat, if it suits you, and make a rouble on every kopeck.’ He lost his temper. But after all, what is goodness? Answer me that, Alexey. Goodness is one thing with me and another with a Chinaman, so it’s a relative thing. Or isn’t it? Is it not relative? ..."

-   Alyosha's conversation with Lise about evil is very interesting! The
    love of crime.

> "...There are moments when people love crime,” said Alyosha thoughtfully. “Yes, yes! You have uttered my thought; they love crime, every one loves crime, they love it always, not at some ‘moments.’ You know, it’s as though people have made an agreement to lie about it and have lied about it ever since. They all declare that they hate evil, but secretly they all love it.”

-   At the point where Smerdyakov is having the second conversation with
    Ivan and Ivan is suspecting he's the real killer of Fyodor Karamazov.

Dmitri can't defend himself to be innocent and was put into prison.
Kolya went to see Illusha and brought him back the dogs.
The conversation between Kolya and the Peasant is hilarious.

> “Nothing could stop me, now I am once off. Hey, good morning,
> peasant!” A sturdy-looking peasant, with a round, simple face and
> grizzled beard, who was walking by, raised his head and looked at the
> boy. He seemed not quite sober.
> “Good morning, if you are not laughing at me,” he said deliberately in
> reply.
> “And if I am?” laughed Kolya.
> “Well, a joke’s a joke. Laugh away. I don’t mind. There’s no harm in a joke.”
> “I beg your pardon, brother, it was a joke.”
> “Well, God forgive you!”
> “Do you forgive me, too?”
> “I quite forgive you. Go along.”
> “I say, you seem a clever peasant.”
> “Cleverer than you,” the peasant answered unexpectedly, with the same gravity. “I doubt it,”
> said Kolya, somewhat taken aback.
> “It’s true, though.” “Perhaps it is.”
> “It is, brother.”
> “Good-bye, peasant!”
> “Good-bye!”
> “There are all sorts of peasants,” Kolya observed to Smurov after a brief
> silence. “How could I tell I had hit on a clever one? I am always
> ready to recognise intelligence in the peasantry.”
