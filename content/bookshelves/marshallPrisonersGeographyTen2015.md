## Summary {#summary}

The book examines how physical surroundings, such as flat land,
navigable rivers and mountains, shape history, culture and
nationhood. It explains how current international conflicts and civil
wars are driven by these elements. It also discusses how leaders and
technological advances can be used to challenge geographical barriers,
but ultimately geography remains a significant factor. Examples are
given of how this has played out in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, the
Arctic and Russia. The book highlights the importance of geography in
understanding global events and the need to consider the impact of
physical surroundings when making foreign policy decisions.
