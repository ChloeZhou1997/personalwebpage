## Motivation for reading {#motivation-for-reading}

-   This is the kind of book that no one can avoid if one wants to
    understand Russian nationhood


## Memo Quote {#memo-quote}

-   Prince Andrew and Piere's conversation

> “If no one fought except on his own conviction, there would be no wars,”

-   Influence has to be exercised if one wants it to last.

> Influence in society, however, is capital which has to be economized
> if it is to last.


## Background {#background}


## Impression {#impression}

Tolstoy's depiction of people is extremely realistic and
refined. However, somehow it feels detached and almost feels like he
doesn't really care about the people that he was writing
about. There's no sympathy in his working.

The part depicting the differences between the aristocrats' life and
other soldiers' life is very touching.

Prince Andrew is the only one that seems likable so far...


### <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2022-12-16 Fri&gt; </span></span> : Reading Progress : 14% {#reading-progress-14}
