I am a heavy reader who loves reading about philosophy, history and
politics. I also love classic literature a lot. Sometimes I read
reviews, analyses and background stories that relate to the pieces I
am reading and the desire to put all those dots together motivates me
to create this site in the first place.

This page is dedicated to the list of books and articles I have read and currently
reading that I find inspiring and interesting.
