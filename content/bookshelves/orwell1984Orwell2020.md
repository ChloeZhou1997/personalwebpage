## Motivation for reading {#motivation-for-reading}

The book itself is well known by people in general but I have always always been one of which who
never read the book before. Being well known as a dystopia book, the book is well known for
depicting a despotism regime. And because of its reputation, I have been kept saying my own home
country converging towards the world in 1984 in an accelerating book.

I just think it's the time I should sit down and read the book in details to be mentally prepared
for what's waiting for my country in the foreseeable forture...


## Background {#background}

The book is published in 1949, but Orwell has more in mind than the anti-comminist sentiments in the
work. In Orwell's thought, he found analogy between the British Labour Party and the Communist Party
under Stalin and consider himself the left of the left. In his idea, both parties claimed to present
the interest of working classes and fight against the communist, but in reality concerned only with
perpetuating their own power.

In 1945, the Tory-led labour party won the British eletorate and got the first time opportunity to
reshape the Biritish society along the socialist line. However, according to his letters, he was
worried how likely the Labour will stick with its original ideals and choose not to extend the scope
of its power. (Judging by the plot of the book he's probably very negative about the prospect...)

Beside, he's very happy about the widespread allgiance to Stalinism among the lefe despite
overwelming evidence of its evil nature, as uncovered from one of his letter he wrote in March of
1948:

> For somewhat complex reasons, nearly the whole of the English Left has been driven to accept the Russian regime as “Socialist”, while silently recognizing that its spirit and practice are quite alien to anything that is meant by “Socialism” in this country. Hence there has arisen a sort of schizophrenic manner of thinking, in which words like “democracy” can bear two irreconcilable meanings, and such things as concentration camps and mass deportations can be right and wrong simultaneously.

### On what's the implication a "future" {#on-what-s-the-implication-a-future}

-   There's no future, if future only resamble the present.

> For whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he writing this diary? For the future, for the unborn. His mind hovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the page, and then fetched up with a bump against the Newspeak word doublethink. For the first time the magnitude of what he had undertaken came home to him. How could you communicate with the future? It was of its nature impossible. Either the future would resemble the present, in which case it would not listen to him: or it would be different from it, and his predicament would be meaningless.


### On group polorization (during three mins hates) {#on-group-polorization--during-three-mins-hates}

> The little sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landed fish. Even O’Brien’s heavy face was flushed. He was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling and quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave. The dark-haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out ‘Swine! Swine! Swine!’, and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen. It struck Goldstein’s nose and bounced off: the voice continued inexorably. In a lucid moment Winston found that he was shouting with the others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair. **The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but that it was impossible to avoid joining in.**


### On sex oppression {#on-sex-oppression}

> It was even possible, at moments, to switch one’s hatred this way or that by a voluntary act. Suddenly, by the sort of violent effort with which one wrenches one’s head away from the pillow in a nightmare, Winston succeeded in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark-haired girl behind him. Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind. He would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon. He would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian. He would ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax. Better than before, moreover, he realized why it was that he hated her. He hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity.

-   It's more intriging than I expected at first...

### <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2022-11-19 Sat&gt; </span></span> : Reading Progress : 15% {#reading-progress-15}

-   Second day reading the book I was too tired yesterday and didn't read a lot...
-   Finished chpater 2, I don't particularly enjoying reading political novel but this book is beyond
    my expectation so far. I love who Owell depicts Winston's revlation during the three mins hates,
    where he realized the hatred towards the sandy-haired woman was due to the carlet sash round her
    sweet, which symbolize the chastity.
